            Gyal on my phone tryna see who I slept with
            She investigating, detective
            Lucky for me, I deleted the message <span>(baby, do you understand)</span>
            All along, it was me and a bad bitch
            But I told her it was me and my bredrin

            If I went court for all of the times I got caught
            I'd have about 16 felons
            I keep comin' with stupid excuses
            Like, "I was juiced and tripped and fell in" <span>(baby, in my hand)</span>
            I might take the risk DMing
            But I don't know 'cause these chicks be tellin'
            At the minute, I'm hittin' some risky women <span>(baby, do you understand)</span>
